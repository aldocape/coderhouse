// Welcome to the TypeScript Playground, this is a website
// which gives you a chance to write, share and learn TypeScript.
// You could think of it in three ways:
//
//  - A location to learn TypeScript where nothing can break
//  - A place to experiment with TypeScript syntax, and share the URLs with others
//  - A sandbox to experiment with different compiler features of TypeScript
